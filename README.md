# GLS Kernel Graph Regression

This repository holds the code relevant for the paper entitled *GLS Kernel Regression for Network-Structured Data* by Edward Antonian, Gareth Peters, Mike Chantler and Hongxuan Yan. In it we  we consider the problem of predicting a signal ***y***<sub>t</sub>, defined across the *N* nodes of a fixed graph, over a series of *T* regularly sampled time points. 

In particular, we analyse the case of a set of pollutant monitoruing stations across Californa.
